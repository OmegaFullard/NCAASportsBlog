                    <h2>Defensive Adjustments</h2>
                    <p>The coaching staff made crucial defensive adjustments at halftime, switching to a more aggressive perimeter defense that disrupted Maryland's rhythm. The Wolverines forced multiple turnovers and converted them into fast-break opportunities.</p>

                    <h2>Player Spotlight</h2>
                    <p>Senior guard leadership was on full display as Michigan's backcourt took control of the game. Quick decision-making and precision passing opened up the offense, leading to high-percentage shots and momentum-changing plays.</p>
